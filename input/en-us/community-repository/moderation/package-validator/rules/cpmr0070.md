Title: CPMR0070 - Package Id uses underscores (nuspec)
Description: Information on how to remediate the Chocolatey Package Moderation Rule 0070

## Issue

In the nuspec, the `<id>` element contains one or more underscores "_" (U+005F).

## Recommended Solution

If this is a new package that has never been approved, moderators will review and reject the package for one that will be pushed with a new id that meets the [package naming guidelines](xref:create-packages#naming-your-package).

If this is an already existing package, there is really nothing you can do at this time aside from deprecate the current package in favor of a newly created one. Please see [deprecating a package](xref:deprecate-a-package)

To change the id of a package source, first change the `<id>` element to the new id, then rename the `.nuspec` to `newid.nuspec` where `newid` is the new id of the package. If applicable, rename the folder containing the package source.

## Reasoning

Naming should be consistent for packages on the community feed so it's easy to understand. Parts of a package id generally should be seperated with a hyphen-minus character "-" (U+002D) or in specific cases a dot "." can be used. See the [package naming guidelines](xref:create-packages#naming-your-package) for more information.
